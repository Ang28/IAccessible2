How to build the IA2 docs, a merged IDL file, a zip file containing the docs and IDL files.
- The directory tree...
  - ia2 contains:
    - this file
    - buildapi.sh: the build script (need cygwin bash shell interpreter installed)
    - doxygen.conf: the doxygen config file (tweaked from the doxygen distribution)
    - doxygen.css: the doxygen css file (tweaked from the doxygen distribution)
    - header.html: contains metadata 
    - footer.html: contains the footer seen on each page
    - changelog.txt: lists changes made since the last release 
    - a merged IDL file with all the IDL concatenated together
    - a zip file containing IDL and doxygen output
    - an api directory which contains the IDL
    - a docs directory which contains the doxygen generated output
    - an IDL-Test directory which contains Visual Studio files for testing:
      - for VC6
        - IA2 IDL Test.dsw/dsp, IA2 Merged IDL Test.dsp, StdAfx.cpp/h
      - for VC 2008 Express
        - IA2 IDL Test.sln/vcproj, IA2 Merged IDL Test.vcproj, StdAfx.cpp/h
- The build procedure
  - CD to the ia2 directory
  - sh buildapi.sh >sh.out
  - notepad sh.out (to check for errors)
  - the doxgen generated files, merged idl file, and the zip file will be built
  - CD to the ia2\IDL-Test directory
  - activate the sln file
  - There are two projects, one for the individual idl files, one for the merged idl file
  - Build, Batch Build, Choose the non-merged IDL project
  - Fix any errors, save the fixes, and rebuild the project.
  - If there were errors, rebuild the merged file by rerunning buildapi.sh
  - Build, Batch Build, Choose the merged IDL project
  - Fix any errors in the original source IDLs or buildapi.sh that caused the problem
  - Rerun the builapi.sh build script.

  Note: Don't fix errors in the merged file; fix them in the correct source file.
